## Overview of the Analysis
> The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

> In this project, I analyzed the category Pet Products for the Amazon database. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I utilized PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
